A bunch of amphpods in different rooms. They want to be sorted.
Take different amounts of energy to move.

Part 1:
What is the least energy required to organize the amphipods?

Here's what I'm thinking. This is a pathfinding problem, and I can use
A* to find the solution. But it won't be finding the path of a
single amphipod to its destination. We will find a path through a
state space where:
* Each node is a state representing the positions of all amphipods
* The edges between nodes represent a move an amphipod can make

The tricky part here is the number of states. There are a huge number
of potential states. I'm not sure the exact number, but
it's something like (15 8) (choose 8 locations for the 8 amphipods) times
4! (from the different ways to place an A, B, C, or D in each space).
Which is on the order of a million or so? Many of them would be inaccessible
from the starting position so we could certainly prune them, which would
limit the size of the state space somewhat. But I just don't
know if it would be worth it to pregenerate all the states vs create them when
we get to them.

I'll come back to that question in a bit.

We need a few things for any search algorithm:
* Nodes/States: the positions of all the amphipods
* Edges/Moves: Moves that amphipods can make to take them from one state to another
* Weights: The cost of each move
* Start: A particular state that we are given to start from
* End: A particular state that we are trying to reach

If we're doing A* we also need a heuristic: A way to determine
how close a given state is to the end state. This is used to determine
which states to give priority to when checking for new states.
Typically on a grid the heuristic would be a distance. But we'll have to get
a bit more creative to create a heuristic in our state space. I don't
know the best way. But I'm thinking I could maybe use the distance of each amphipod
from its goal position, with an additional penality if one is in the correct state but
blocking one that is in an incorrect goal space. And maybe the cost of the moves
should also be factored in?

I'm looking at this guide to A*:
https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html
The A* algorithm is guaranteed to find the best path if the heuristic is "admissable"
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_heuristic) i.e. the heuristic to reach
the goal from state n is always less than or equal to the true cost to reach the
goal from state n.
That makes me think the heuristic should be the cost to move all the amphipods
into the correct spots, ignoring any interactions. Like "how many spaces are you away
from your goal space, and what does it cost to move there".
As if they can move through each other. That will always be less than or equal
to the true cost, since they will definitely need to move at least that many spaces.
